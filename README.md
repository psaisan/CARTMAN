# CARTMAN

Understanding gene regulation requires exploring complex genomic sequence structures beyond individual transcription factor motifs. CARTMAN (**C**o-occurrence **A**nalysis of **R**epeating **T**ranscription-factor **M**otifs **A**nd **N**etworks) enables discovery and quantification of motif co-occurrences within regulatory sequences and differential analysis of motif complexes across biological contexts. In contrast to high complexity machine learning approaches, MCAT offers straightforward and interpretable measures while minimizing computational overhead and user background requirements. MCAT motif co-occurrence constructs parallel the simplicity and interpretability of individual motif descriptors, representing a logical progression of well established genomic discovery tools like HOMER. Application to ChIP-seq data revealed distinct motif combinations between Sall1 knockout and wild-type cells, demonstrating its ability to detect subtle regulatory differences beyond individual motif sets.
