## Abstract

Understanding gene regulation requires exploring complex genomic sequence structures beyond individual transcription factor motifs. **CARTMAN** (Co-occurrence Analysis of Repeating Transcription-factor Motifs And Networks) is a software tool that performs discovery and quantification of motif co-occurrences within regulatory sequences and enables downstream differential analysis of motif complexes across distinct experimental conditions. Unlike high-complexity machine learning approaches, CARTMAN offers straightforward and interpretable measures minimizing computational overhead and user background requirements. CARTMANâ€™s motif co-occurrence constructs parallel the simplicity and interpretability of motifs as co-occurrence of individual nucleotides, representing a logical and natural progression of well-established genomic motif discovery tools like [HOMER](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/) and [FIMO](https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/fimo).
