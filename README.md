## Abstract

Understanding gene regulation requires exploring complex genomic sequence structures beyond individual transcription factor motifs. **CARTMAN** (Co-occurrence Analysis of Repeating Transcription-factor Motifs And Networks) is a software tool that enables the discovery and quantification of motif co-occurrences within regulatory sequences and performs differential analysis of motif complexes across distinct experimental conditions. Unlike high-complexity machine learning approaches, CARTMAN offers straightforward and interpretable measures minimizing computational overhead and user background requirements. CARTMANâ€™s motif co-occurrence constructs parallel the simplicity and interpretability of motifs as co-occurance of individual nucleotides, representing a logical and natural progression of well-established genomic motif discovery tools like HOMER and FIMO.

## Features

- **Motif Co-occurrence Table Generation:** Given a set of target motifs file and a genomic peaks file, CARTMAN constructs and quantifies all possible motif combinations found within the genomic peaks. 
- **Differential Analysis:** Compares motif co-occurrence between two peak sets to identify significant differences.
- **Result Integration:** Outputs normalized counts and significance levels and a number of different visualizations of the motif co-occurances in peak files.
